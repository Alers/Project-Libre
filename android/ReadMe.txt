This directory includes the Project Libre SDK for Android.

To use this in your own Android app, just copy the code and libraries to your own project structure.
You can either just use the SDKConnection or LiveChatConnection API, or use, or customize the activities for your content.

To create a new Android app you will need to download the Android SDK and Eclipse for Android,

http://developer.android.com/sdk

http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html

Simply create a new Android project from Eclipse, copy the src, res, and libs, folders to your project, customize the MainActivity for your content, and package your very own Android apk app file.

You are free to upload the apk to whatever service you wish, and charge whatever you wish for it.
